  ## Description:
  A budget tracker webapp that can be run in online and offline mode.

  ## Technologies:
  * NodeJS
  * HTML
  * CSS
  * MongoDB
  * Heroku


  ## Notes:
  - App is built with offline functionality in mind. As such, it utilizes indexedDB for browser storage wil offline. It inckudes a manifest and service worker with instructions to cache files necessary for the app to run while there is no network connection. Once the connecton is re-established, the app automatically syncs (data stored in indexedDB while offline) with the server.
